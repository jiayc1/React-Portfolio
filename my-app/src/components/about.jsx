              <p>Hello! My name is Jessica Chen and I am currently in Orange County! During the day time, I am a product manager at a Mortgage software company. 
                At night time, I am learning how to code! One day, I want to be a technical product or program manager once I learn more about coding.  If I have an adjective to describe myself, I am spontaneous Jess! Recently, I went to get my eyes checked and 
                ended up getting Lasik the same day! That is how spontaneous I am!

              <p>My favorite hobbies are to go hiking with my dogs, baking with friends, and listening to audible while I walk. My current favorite hiking places are Top of the World, 
                Peters Canyon, and Boomer Canyon. As for baking, I love to bake japanese cheesecake and banana bread. When I take walks, I love to listen to audible and I am currently
                listening to Obama's new book "A Promised Land.""
