              <p>Hello! My name is Jessica Chen and I am currently in Orange County! During the day time, I am a product manager at a software company. 
                At night time, I am continuing to learn new fun things just like coding! 
              <br/>
              </p>
              <p>My favorite hobbies are to go hiking with my dogs, baking with friends, and listening to audible while I walk. My current favorite hiking places are Top of the World, 
                Peters Canyon, and Boomer Canyon. As for baking, I love to bake japanese cheesecake and banana bread. When I take walks, I love to listen to audible and I am currently
                listening to "Start with Why."
              </p>
              <p>
